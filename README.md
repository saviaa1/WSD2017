In this project, we will build a space ship powered by waste
cooker oil. Helm is string operated.

#### 3.2. Control Methods

* Left string
* Right string
* Hand brake

#### 3.3. Priorities

We will prioritize gun assembly as space ship without a big
gun is a gunless space ship.


### 4. Process and Time Schedule

We communicate using smoke signals at 1 p.m. The finished
modules are taken to north pole using goverment post services.

* Weeks 1-2: The streams must not cross.
* Weeks 3-4: If at the hour of despair the streams cross
	no-one will mention it.
* Monday, Feb 1st: We shall meet at Stonehenge and check that
	Egon has delivered proton packs to New York.


### 5. Testing

Every module is dropped from 3rd floor and the remaining parts
go into the envelope.


### 6. Risk Analysis

If joker shall awaken he will insert kryptonite in our porridge.
